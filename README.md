# Django Middleware Introduction Project

This project serves as an introduction to Django middleware and demonstrates its usage in a web application. Middleware in Django is a powerful tool that allows you to process requests and responses globally, performing actions such as authentication, logging, modifying headers, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple Django web application and implement custom middleware to perform some common tasks. The project structure and implementation details are outlined below.

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
project/
    ├── myapp/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    ├── middleware/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── custom_middleware.py
    ├── templates/
    │   └── base.html
    ├── manage.py
    └── README.md
```

- The `myapp` directory contains the Django project settings and configuration files.
- The `middleware` directory contains the custom middleware implementation.
- The `templates` directory contains the base HTML template for the application.
- The `manage.py` file is used to manage various aspects of the Django project.

### Custom Middleware

The `custom_middleware.py` file in the `middleware` directory is where you will define your custom middleware classes. This project aims to demonstrate the usage of middleware by implementing two simple examples:

1. `RequestTimeMiddleware`: This middleware calculates and adds the total time taken to process a request in milliseconds. It displays this time in the application's base template.
2. `MaintenanceModeMiddleware`: This middleware checks if the application is in maintenance mode and displays an appropriate message to users.

Feel free to modify or expand upon these examples to further explore the capabilities of Django middleware.

### Base Template

The `base.html` file in the `templates` directory serves as the base HTML template for the application. This template includes the necessary HTML structure and provides a location to display the request time and maintenance mode messages.

## Getting Started

To run this Django project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```
   $ git clone <repository-url>
   $ cd project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```
   $ python3 -m venv env
   $ source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:

   ```
   $ python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   $ python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Conclusion

This Django middleware introduction project provides a starting point
to understand the concept and implementation 
of middleware in a Django web application. Feel free to explore and modify the middleware
classes to suit your specific needs. Happy coding!
